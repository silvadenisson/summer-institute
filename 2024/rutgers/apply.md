# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. We welcome applications from all fields of study and encourage those from individuals in groups currently under-represented in computational social science. There are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. However, we are unable to provide funding for travel or lodging during the institute.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete SICSS boot camp. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold limited online office hours during the month before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a cover letter of interest (three pages, maximum) detailing your current position and research interests, experience and/or interest in computational social science, and reasons for applying to the institute with an eye toward addressing each element of how we indicate applications will be evaluated and (iii) one writing sample, not exceeding 35 pages. The writing sample can be published or unpublished working paper, seminar paper, or prospectus. It need not demonstrate knowledge of computational social science. A successful working paper will amplify the other parts of your application by showcasing substantive interests, computational interest or skill, and/or your general research skills.

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by March 22 through the Google form available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6DCwia86IX5j8L3Mn2nC6KXXXHhesn-N643sTAZ67J13azw/viewform).** Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail by approximately April 15, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to sicssrutgers@gmail.com.

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Rutgers, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Rutgers if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
