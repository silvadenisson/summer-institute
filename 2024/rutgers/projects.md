# Participant-led group projects

An important element of the Summer Institute is the participant-led group projects that begin in the second week and often continue long after the Summer Institute ends. Some participants at past SICSS-Rutgers institutes have gone on to publish projects that extend on their group work. See examples below:

- Barnett, Carolyn; FitzGerald, Michael; Krumbholz, Katie; Lamba, Manika. 2022. "Gender Research in Political Science Journals: A Dataset" forthcoming in PS: Political Science and Politics.

- Shin, Inyoung; Wang, Luxuan; Lu, Yi-Ta. 2022. Twitter and Endorsed (Fake) News: The Influence of Endorsement by Strong Ties, Celebrities, and a User Majority on Credibility of Fake News During the COVID-19 Pandemic. International Journal Of Communication, 16(23). https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/18187/3776
