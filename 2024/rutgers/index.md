From June 17-28, 2024, Rutgers University will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at Rutgers University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. The first week of the program will focus on training and group exercises, and the second week will provide participants with opportunities to launch collaborative research projects. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to doctoral students (current and newly admitted), postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend in person and participate in the entire two-week program. We are currently unable to provide travel and lodging funds for institute participants.

Application materials are due March 22. Applicants will be notified by approximately April 15, 2024. Inquiries may be sent to sicssrutgers@gmail.com.
