From July 8 to July 20, 2024, the Computational Social Science Lab, the Data Driven Discovery Initiative, the Population Studies Center, the School of Arts and Sciences, the Department of Sociology, and the Annenberg School for Communication at Penn will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, to be held at the University of Pennsylvania. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, post-doctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire two-week program.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/penn/apply) are due Friday, March 15th, 2024, at 11:59 PM EST.
