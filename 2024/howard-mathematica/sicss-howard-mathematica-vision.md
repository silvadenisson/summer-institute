#### SICSS-Howard/Mathematica Vision
The purpose of the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. For SICSS-Howard/Mathematica, we have an added purpose: to seed and grow a depth of knowledge and appreciation for computational social science in underrepresented communities. SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is uniquely poised to highlight innovative methods to conduct social research on topics of pertinence to underrepresented communities using real-world data. Participants who share our drive to use computer science, data analytics, and evidence to improve public well-being within underrepresented communities will benefit from the opportunities and resources that are unique to SICSS-Howard/Mathematica given our presence at Howard University, the generous support and deep engagement of Mathematica, and our presence in the nation’s capital.

#### Howard University
Established in 1867, Howard University is a federally chartered, private, doctoral degree granting Historically Black University. With an enrollment of over 9,000 students (3,000 of which are graduate students), its undergraduate, graduate, professional, and joint degree programs span more than 120 areas of study within 13 schools and colleges. The historic main campus sits on two hundred and fifty-six acres on a hilltop in Northwest Washington blocks from the storied U Street and Howard Theatre and two miles from the U.S. Capitol. Howard University’s founding of SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is yet another way that Howard continues its commitment to the context of our founding – an unwavering question to balance the scales for the disenfranchised and promote an American that is devoid of inequalities. Howard has existed to address a plethora of disparities that disproportionately affect the African American population wherever it may occur. Computational Social Science presents a rapidly evolving frontier where new voices are needed more than ever to promote Veritas and Utilitas (Truth and Service).

#### Mathematica
Founded in 1968, Mathematica reimagines the way the world gathers and uses data, surfacing evidence and insights that illuminate the path to progress for public- and private-sector changemakers. Driven by our mission to improve public well-being and our steadfast commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion, Mathematica’s nearly 1400 employees collaborate closely with public- and private-sector partners to inform program and policy decisions in health, human services, and international development. Throughout SICSS-Howard/Mathematica, our data and public policy experts will support participants to help translate big questions into deep insights that improve programs, refine strategies, and enhance equity.
