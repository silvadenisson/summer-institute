From July 13 to July 26, 2024, Howard University and Mathematica will sponsor the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, virtually at Howard University. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). <i>There is no cost to participate in SICSS-Howard/Mathematica.</i>

The instructional program involves lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There are also outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There are ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute are released open source.

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, Masters students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants are invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

SICSS-Howard/Mathematica is groundbreaking for a number of reasons, including: 1) we were the first and only (2021, 2022, and 2023) Summer Institute held at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), 2) we once again had the benefit of a deeply invested partner, Mathematica, and finally, 3) we continued our topical focus on anti-Black racism and inequity.

[Application materials](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2024/howard-mathematica/apply) are due 11:59pm EST on March 31st, 2024.
