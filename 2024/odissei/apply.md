# Apply

## Eligibility

Our primary target audience consists of PhD students, post-docs and early career researchers. The targeted fields of research are principally sociology, psychology, economics and political science. However, it will be possible for other individuals or junior researchers actively involved or interested in related fields to apply for the programme.

The Summer School is open to participants working inside and outside of ODISSEI member organisations, including those working outside of the Netherlands, but all participants must have a contract of employment at a research organization that has a signed association agreement with Statistics Netherlands by the start of the Summer School. We will support participants in getting this agreement in place if it is not already. About 20 participants will be invited.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions:  
 
1. research and teaching in the area of computational social science  
2. contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others  
3. likelihood to benefit from participation  
4. likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants  
5. potential to spread computational social science throughout the ODISSEI community.  

Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

Accepted participants can participate in this programme for free. Lunch will be provided, and ODISSEI will host some social events during the course.  
  
Participants will need to cover all travel costs themselves. However, ODISSEI aims to provide accommodation to those who live more than 30 minutes away from campus. Travel time will be calculated via [9292ov.nl](http://9292ov.nl/). The address of the Erasmus campus is Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA Rotterdam. Accommodation will be provided from Monday to Friday (4 nights each week). Those who do not live in the Netherlands can additionally request accommodation for the weekend of 22-23 June.

### Application Frequently Asked Questions

<i>Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?</i><br>
Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-ODISSEI, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

<i>Can I participate in SICSS-ODISSEI if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?</i><br>
No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
