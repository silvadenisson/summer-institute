# Apply

## Eligibility

Participation is restricted to Master's students, PhD students or professionals in the Social Sciences (Sociology, Political Science, Communication or related areas), who wish to deepen their knowledge in the use of computational methods and tools for the analysis of social data. However, there are no restrictions based on citizenship, country of study, or country of employment. About 15 participants will be invited.

The Summer Institute aims to bring together computational social scientists across all levels of technical experience. Participants with less experience with social science research will be expected to complete additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding will be expected to complete a set of online learning modules on the R programming language. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours during the two months before the Institute.

We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research. Further, when making our evaluations, we attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.

## How To Apply

Applicants must submit the following documents: (i) submit their curriculum vitae and (ii) fill out a form describing their research topics and interest in computational social science. In addition, we encourage participants to share an optional writing sample.


**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials must be submitted by Wednesday, May 1, 2024 at 23:59 UYT.** All application materials must be submitted through [this form](https://forms.gle/pcJXRLtWY96PY8eE7). Applications that are not complete by the deadline may not receive full consideration. We will notify applicants solely through e-mail in June, and will ask participants to confirm their participation very soon thereafter.

Inquiries can be sent to [escuela.computacionales@cienciassociales.edu.uy](escuela.computacionales@cienciassociales.edu.uy)

## Application Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I apply to more than one Summer Institute location?

Yes, but not at the same time. For example, you can apply to SICSS-Uruguay, and then if you are not accepted you can apply to one of the other locations if it has a later deadline. However, you cannot have an applications under review at two locations simultaneously.

#### Can I participate in SICSS-Uruguay if I have already participated in SICSS at another location?

No. Every year we have more applicants than we can accept, and we would like everyone to have a chance to participate in SICSS once before we allow folks to participate twice.
