From July 15 to July 28, 2023, Howard University and Mathematica sponsored the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, virtually at Howard University. The purpose of the Summer Institute was to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science. The Summer Institute was for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). <i>There is no cost to participate in SICSS-Howard/Mathematica.</i>

The instructional program involved lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There were also outside speakers who conduct computational social science research in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, machine learning, and ethics. There were ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute were released open source.

Participation was restricted to Ph.D. students, Masters students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty within 7 years of their Ph.D. We welcomed applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. About thirty participants were invited, and participants were expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.

SICSS-Howard/Mathematica was once again groundbreaking for a number of reasons, including: 1) we were the first (2021) and continue to be the only (2022 and 2023) Summer Institute held at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU), 2) we once again had the benefit of a deeply invested partner, Mathematica, and finally, 3) we continued our topical focus on anti-Black racism and inequity.

Application materials were due 11:59pm EST on March 31st. ~~Submitted applications currently under review. Rolling admission until full.~~ No longer accepting applications.
